# Getting-and-cleaning-data
##Project for Getting and Cleaning data Coursera

The assignement is as follows:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run the process:
1. Download the datafile and place in your working directory
2. Put run_analysis.R in the working directory
3. Run source("run_analysis.R"), which will create a file named tidy_data.txt in the working directory.


## Dependencies
The process requires you to have installed the packages: data.table and reshape2
